# Jungle Beats

#### A (very) basic data structure built using the linked list method, to store individual beats that can be played back through the terminal.

* My first attempt at this upon my first go at Module 1 was a bit of a disaster as I still struggled to understand the logic and structure behind what I was building. This time around, I worked hard to figure out what exactly was going on and the concept's behind it.
* While I can't call it easy, it certainly was a easier go this time instead of at 3am pushing the deadline in a few hours.
* This go around I have a much better understanding of the conceptual build or attributes that create the linked list and how to share the work
* For this project, I stuck to creating my methods using iteration and looping rather than recursion.
